Description: STICr (pronounced "sticker") includes a collection of functions for tidying and processing raw data from Stream Temperature, Intermittency, and Conductivity (STIC) loggers. These include functions for tidying the raw data from the loggers (tidy_hobo_data), creating a calibration model object from calibration standard data (get_calibration), apply this object to generate a column for specific conductivity (apply_calibration), and create a binary wet/dry column (classify_wetdry).
