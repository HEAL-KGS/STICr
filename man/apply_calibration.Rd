\arguments{
\item{stic_data}{A data frame with a column named `conductivity_uncal`, for example as produced by the function `tidy_hobo_data`.}

\item{calibration}{a model object relating `conductivity_uncal` to a standard of some sort, for example as produced by the function `get_calibration`.}
}
\value{
